description: 'The purpose of this project is to help you gain experience in (1) designing
  and implementing programs in the functional style (that is, making extensive use
  of functions over immutable types); (2) designing and implementing abstract types;
  and (3) using common design patterns for constructing and traversing structures
  (such as Variant as Class, Interpreter, Iterator, and Visitor). It also introduces
  you to the fundamentals of compilation, in particular: (4) expressing a language
  as a grammar; (5) converting a text to an abstract syntax tree; and (5) organizing
  a compiler into phases (lexing, parsing, static semantic analysis, etc). Finally,
  the project will give you further practice in software engineering fundamentals,
  such as (6) clarifying a problem statement; (7) inventing clear and simple interfaces
  to minimize coupling, and identifying and resolving undesirable dependences; (8)
  structuring a program to make it easily testable, organizing, executing and evaluating
  test suites; and (9) working collaboratively in a team.'
